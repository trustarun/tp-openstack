Requirement :
**************
	=> puppet master server need to be linux machine. window can't be puppet master
	=> deployment type can be agent/master or standalone puppet. In later case you need to manually run puppet apply.
	   agent/master is default
	=> master server need to be roubst machine, with good LAN connection. It need to be always available.
	   for standalone puppet, you do not need to worry of LAN and always Up requirement.but You will need to come 
	   up with your own solution for distributing updated manifests, modules, and data to each node
    => Your puppet master server must have a FQDN
	=> Network configuration:
	   -> if behind fireball, allow incoming connection to port 8140
	   -> Every node must have a unique hostname. Forward and reverse DNS must both be configured correctly. 
       ->The default puppet master hostname is puppet. Your agent nodes can be ready sooner if this
		  hostname resolves to your puppet master.
	=> check time setting of server having puppet master
		The puppet master server that will be acting as the certificate authority should have its system time set accurately.
		You should probably use NTP.
		(If it doesn’t, it may mistakenly issue agent certificates from the distant past or future, 
		which other nodes will treat as expired.)
    => Need to have root access to system. Different commands need superuser privelege to execute.

Prepare Puppet Installation dependency:
***************************************
    Note : The server used is a UBUNTU machine.Adjust you command if you are on some other flavour of Linux

	=> pre-requirement:
		   1-  sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1 #Install ruby(any of 1.8.7, 1.9.3, 2.0.x)
		   2-  sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1-dev # needed by other gems to build native extensions
           3-  sudo apt-get install rubygems
		   4-  sudo apt-get install facter # install facter
           5-  sudo apt-get install git # needed to clone puppet repositories
		   6-  sudo gem install hiera  # install hiera
		   7-  sudo gem install json
		   8-  sudo gem install json
		   9-  sudo gem install rgen
		  10-  sudo gem install msgpack

	=> Add puppet repository to Apt packages:
	   It can be found at  https://apt.puppetlabs.com/ . They have different files

		Debian 6 “Squeeze” (obsolete stable release) (also supported by Puppet Enterprise)
		Debian 7 “Wheezy” (current stable release) (also supported by Puppet Enterprise)
		Ubuntu 14.04 LTS “Trusty Tahr” (also supported by Puppet Enterprise)
		Ubuntu 12.04 LTS “Precise Pangolin” (also supported by Puppet Enterprise)
		Ubuntu 10.04 LTS “Lucid Lynx” (also supported by Puppet Enterprise)

	   Since your OS is Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, you should download

	   puppetlabs-release-trusty.deb	26-Aug-2014 10:21 	7.2K
	   These file just set puppetlab to apt-get

	=> $ wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-trusty.deb
	   $ sudo dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-trusty.deb
	   $ sudo apt-get update
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Install puppet master :
***************************
	
   => sudo apt-get install puppetmaster-passenger .

		 Warning: Setting templatedir is deprecated. See http://links.puppetlabs.com/env-settings-deprecations
		   (at /usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/puppet/settings.rb:1117:in `issue_deprecation_warning')
                       
		 AH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1. 
		 Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message

         NOTE : you get a error and a warning at this stage.We will fix this under post installation configuration part.

		To fix the apache error:
		-> open the conf file :nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and add below at the end
			
           ServerName localhost 
  


	=> sudo apt-get install puppetmaster
		This will install Puppet, its prerequisites, and an init script (/etc/init.d/puppetmaster) 
		for running a test-quality puppet master server. do not start the puppet master now.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Configure Puppet Master :
***************************
	=> configure /etc/hosts

		You may have single puppet master or multiple master with a Central Master, balancing all other. 
        For your case, it is single master for now or you can say that it is your CA master.

		Your master should be on server with fqdn. since, currently you have not purchased any domain name, 
        you can add it to /etc/hosts file name.
		It look as below.

		27.0.0.1        localhost
		10.1.5.143      puppet01.thirdpillar.com        puppet01

	=> Remove templatedir from puppet.conf 	(/etc/puppet/puppet.conf)
   		
		templatedir directive is depricated for puppet above 3.0. So remove the below line from main section

		templatedir=$confdir/templates

	=> Add dns_alt_names directive (/etc/puppet/puppet.conf)
		
		Add the below line to puppet.conf file under main section      

		dns_alt_names = puppet01.thirdpillar.com 
  
    => Add server directive (/etc/puppet/puppet.conf)
       This is very important as all the agent will try to connect to this server at the port 8140

        Add the below line to puppet.conf file under main section

        server = puppet01.thirdpillar.com 

       NOTE : the server name should be a fully qualified domain name(fqdn)
		
    => generate certificate for the master
    
       once you have added dns_alt_names directive above, starting the puppet master will generate the certificates
       for you.

		# sudo puppet master --verbose --no-daemonize
		Warning: Setting templatedir is deprecated. See http://links.puppetlabs.com/env-settings-deprecations
		   (at /usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/puppet/settings.rb:1095:in `block in issue_deprecations')
		Notice: Starting Puppet master version 3.6.2
		Error: Could not run: Address already in use - bind(2)

		Try after killing apache2

		root@arun-desktop:/etc/puppet# ps -ef | grep apache2
		www-data 10916  1763  0 12:48 ?        00:00:03 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
		root     22977 22461  0 17:00 pts/1    00:00:00 grep --color=auto apache2
		root@arun-desktop:/etc/puppet# kill -9 10916
		root@arun-desktop:/etc/puppet# ps -ef | grep apache2
		root     22979 22461  0 17:01 pts/1    00:00:00 grep --color=auto apache2
		root@arun-desktop:/etc/puppet# sudo puppet master --verbose --no-daemonize
		Notice: Starting Puppet master version 3.6.2

		press cnt+ c to stop it

		Now if you go to ssl dir (/var/lib/puppet/ssl), you have configured above, you can see the certificates there

Installing puppet agent:
******************************

	It can be on separate machine other then master, but for now, it will be on your same machine

	NOTE : the pre requirement will be same as for the master

    sudo apt-get install puppet
	  * Starting puppet agent 
                                                                                                                      
	  puppet not configured to start, please edit /etc/default/puppet to enable 


_____________________________________________________________________________________

STARTING puppet agent:
**************************

	STEP 1: enabling puppet agent start 
		As you have seen the message above "puppet not configured to start" . To allow agent to start
		edit /etc/default/puppet file. change the value of START from no to yes

	STEP 2: Start the puppet agent:
        puppet agent -t --debug --verbos
